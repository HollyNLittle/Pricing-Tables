            <h2>How I ended up pursuing a profession that I never even considered...</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Growing up with a father in the burgeoning computer programming field, I
                remember computer related parts, books and printers as being ubiquitous in our
                home.
            </p>
            <p>
                The memories of the noise of the printers, the green and white striped paper,
                floppy discs, hard discs, are especially strong. I watched the book titles and job
                titles as they changed over the years; COBOL, networking, systems engineer and so
                on.
            </p>
            <img src="images/MyChildhoodPhoto.jpg" class="about-me-image" />

            <p>
                Shortly after graduating from Miami University with a Bachelor's Degree of Fine
                Arts and a major in Studio Arts and Printmaking, I was living at home, working in
                the education field and raising my son. My father, who had long complained around
                the dinner table of frustration in what he found to be a dearth of good,
                knowledgeable, computer programming professionals to hire to complete different
                projects, brought an O'Reilly book on Java programming to me, directing me to learn
                how to program so I could help him on his current project.
            </p>

            <p>
                Without so much as questioning the rather abrupt request to learn how to program,
                I delved in intent on
                helping and being sure to in now way let my dad down. I fell in love with O'Reilly,
                turning to other publishers as needed but I still recommend Head First series.
                After I had been programming for some time my father said that the company
                needed a website and directed me to create one. Again, turning to books, I delved
                into HTML, XHTML, CSS and Photoshop eventually building that website, taking and
                passing the test to become an Adobe Certification Expert and then teaching
                Photoshop to others at the local community college.
            </p>
            <p>

                Once, my father's work was done at that particular company he encouraged me to
                take the Java certification exam and take on a job search as a computer programmer.
                However, in spite of his encouragement and my successfully utilizing the loops,
                arrays, garbage collection and so forth that I had intently studied I was not ready to
                embark on a job search in the field, feeling no confidence in my skill set as I had no
                certificate, degree or experience working for a person that wasn't a relative. I
                continued in the education field as the art teacher at a daycare and later teaching
                and tutoring at the Lorain Juvenile Detention Facility, followed by work as a
                Resolution Specialist first at Nissan and then at Progressive where I am currently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, during this time I raised two sons and sent my oldest son off to college. I was
                considering my next steps careerwise, the possibility of pursuing a master's degree
                in business or continuing to work my way up in my current work area, when I heard
                an advertisement for We Can Code IT that I had already heard many times. For
                some reason, this particular morning upon hearing the ad I determined that I would
                pursue that path. Now, I am well into the program, have met new people, learned
                more in a short period of time than I would have thought possible and successfully
                completed projects using a myriad of programs and languages. The experience has
                been rewarding, challenging, fun and frustrating all at once, but I am so glad that I
                decided to walk down this path and am now tentatively making contacts and
                preparing to start my job search in earnest.

            <p>
                When I explained to my manager that I was embarking on this journey, her
                response was enthusiastic support and she commented that I was brave. I
                encourage anyone reading this that has considered pursuing a similar life change, to
                go for it. After some years in the workforce, I have come to realize that the primary
                difference between those that do and the rest of us, is neither an expensive degree
                nor a brilliant mind, but a belief they can.

                those of you considering or in the process of a mid-life switch in careers.  If you are considering a coding bootcamp
                and have any questions, please feel free to either make use of the contact form or connect with me via any of the following.
